# Linked Data Stock Broker

DBPedia is a semantic resource that links data using RDF.

Proposal for the stock broker system is to use StockCode--CompanyName rdf links to pull information from DBpedia about a company.

```
Company: name
	has A : Stock Code
		Value of: code
```		
		
example
```
Amgen
	Stock Code
		AMG
```

# RDF Schema
